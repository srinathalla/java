/**
 * A frog is crossing a river. The river is divided into x units and at each
 * unit there may or may not exist a stone. The frog can jump on a stone, but it
 * must not jump into the water.
 * 
 * Given a list of stones' positions (in units) in sorted ascending order,
 * determine if the frog is able to cross the river by landing on the last
 * stone. Initially, the frog is on the first stone and assume the first jump
 * must be 1 unit.
 * 
 * If the frog's last jump was k units, then its next jump must be either k - 1,
 * k, or k + 1 units. Note that the frog can only jump in the forward direction.
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * The number of stones is â‰¥ 2 and is < 1,100. Each stone's position will be a
 * non-negative integer < 231. The first stone's position is always 0.
 * 
 * [0,1,3,5,6,8,12,17]
 * 
 * There are a total of 8 stones. The first stone at the 0th unit, second stone
 * at the 1st unit, third stone at the 3rd unit, and so on... The last stone at
 * the 17th unit.
 * 
 * Return true. The frog can jump to the last stone by jumping 1 unit to the 2nd
 * stone, then 2 units to the 3rd stone, then 2 units to the 4th stone, then 3
 * units to the 6th stone, 4 units to the 7th stone, and 5 units to the 8th
 * stone.
